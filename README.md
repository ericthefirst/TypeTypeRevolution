# TypeTypeRevolution
Inspired by Dance Dance Revolution, this typing program will train the user to type keys in rhythm.

Currently, the program only features functionality to record keypresses, and play the accompanying notes.

To get this going, you'll have to install Minim, as the version that comes with Processing is apparently lacking in some way.  
Just follow the instructions on the Minim <a href="https://github.com/ddf/Minim"> github page</a>.
