# TypeTypeRevolution
Inspired by Dance Dance Revolution, this typing program will train the user to type keys in rhythm.

Currently, the program only features functionality to accept the key presses, play the corresponding notes, and log the key presses to an output file.  I'll be using this data to construct levels that match what users intuitively do when they're limited to a subset of the keyboard.

To get this pre-pre-alpha version going, you'll have to install Minim, as the version that comes with Processing is apparently lacking in some way.  Just follow the instructions on the Minim <a href="https://github.com/ddf/Minim"> github page</a>.
